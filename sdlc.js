/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis =  "This is the second step, determine what are the business rules that you need to follow. What are the data models going to look like"

const design = "This is the third step, this is where features and operations are discussed in detail with all people involved in the project. Coding begins here."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, you start launching the software"

const testing = "This is the fifth step, as you work on coding the project and testing it out, you should give the customer versions of the product so you can get feedback."

const maintain = "This is the sixth and final step, after the software has been pushed out, you have to maintain it. Many ways to maintain the app whether it is by removing bugs or keeping it up to date, with updates."
